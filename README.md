#  Sales-Dashboard

Business Scenario :

Natalie Mounier, the CEO of a retail products company, is very focused on the sales of the products her company sells, as she needs to deliver a presentation on the company’s sales results to the company’s Board of Directors every quarter. Natalie is also interested in sales performance across the company’s four regions, as she is also responsible for setting sales performance targets for her sales teams in each region. Natalie wants to build a dashboard that will present some metrics about products (such as sales, profits, profit ratio, etc.). Natalie also wants to be able to see the trends of these statistics over time, and be able to filter down to one, more than one, or all geographic regions.
